Key Insights

1. Monthly Sales Trend & MoM Growth

Sales generally showed steady improvement, with some months underperforming.

Strongest growth observed during peak months from oct to mar, suggesting seasonal influence.

Business Note: Seasonal promotions can boost peak periods, while weaker months need additional campaigns.

2. Profit by Category

Furniture (9.6%) is the weakest segment.

Business Note: Focus on Clothing & Electronics. Reconsider pricing/marketing strategy for Furniture.

3. Sales vs Target

Business Note: Targets should be more aligned with realistic performance expectations.

Indore and Mumbai generate the highest revenue.

Delhi and Bhopal have lower contributions.

Business Note: Increase efforts in high-performing cities, while building strategies to grow weaker ones.

5. Top Customers

Top 5 customers contribute significantly, with Yaanvi & Pooja being the most valuable.
